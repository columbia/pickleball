PickleBall protects users when loading untrusted pickle-based machine learning
models.

PickleBall ensures that the when loading an untrusted model, only functions
that are necessary for loading the model are executed. PickleBall infers this
allowed code by analyzing the source code of the machine learning library used
to produce the model.

To use PickleBall, you must know the library that produced the model (often the
same as the library used to load the model) and the Python class of the model.

PickleBall works in two steps:
1. Policy inference: generate a model loading policy.
2. Policy enforcement: enforce a model loading policy.

Policy inference only needs to run once per machine learning library.

## Overview

Primary components:

* `pickleball-generate.py`: the entry-point to PickleBall's analysis. It
  collects arguments and invokes the analysis.
* `analyze/analyze.sc`: PickleBall's policy generation analysis. Implemented as
  a Joern script in Scala. This is invoked with Joern by `pickleball-generate.py`
  and outputs a policy as a JSON file.
* `enforce/enforce.py`: PickleBall's policy enforcement. Implemented as
  modifications to the Pickle Machine and serves as a drop in replacement. We
  provide Dockerfiles for configuring an environment to use the module. Reads
  policies generated by `analyze.sc`.

## Evaluation Setup

Create a .env file that defines the following environment variables:

```
BENIGN_MODELS=<path to benign model dataset>
MALICIOUS_MODELS=<path to malicious model dataset>
DATASETS=<path to evaluation datasets>
```

Build all evaluation containers:

```
$ docker compose build
```

Generate policies for evaluation dataset:

```
$ docker compose run generate-all
```

Policies will be output in the `evaluation/policies` directory.

Enforce policies:

```
$ docker compose run enforce-all
```

## Policy Generation

PickleBall uses the Joern program analysis platform to generate policies for
model class objects. The policy need only be generated once for a given class,
and then used anytime a model of that class is loaded.

## Run Joern tests

In the policy generation docker container:

```
# python3 runtests.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Joern crash

Non-determinism in Joern may result in a crash on some executions. If one
occurs, first try re-executing Joern. If this occurs while running the inference
test suite, first re-execute the test suite. You can also run individual tests
by providing them as arguments by name with the `--fixtures` option. List all
available tests with the `--list` option.
