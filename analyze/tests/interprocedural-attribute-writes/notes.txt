Test fails because analysis does not follow the Optimizer class down to its
subclasses (misses SGD).
- This is really because "Optimizer" is a collection type and needs to be
  unparsed from it.
- The name on the queue is "__collection.Optimizer" but we need to replace it
  with "Optimizer" and then ultimately, the full name for Optimizer
